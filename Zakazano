What about change like this ? ECHO %%A | find "yourWord" >> outputFile.txt
Unless you want more sophisticated search using Cygwin or PowerShell ? 
But it could be quite slow to iterate file lines using batch script, maybe short C# code compiled by CSC would perform way better... 
Let me know if you want it.
My test batch looks like this now, but unless you filter before processing count works on source lines and not on result (some may be empty).
